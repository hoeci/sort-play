## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features
+ **Comprehensive Sorting:** Sort playlists, albums and artist pages by global play count, popularity, release date, album color, Last.fm scrobbles, Last Scrobbled, tempo, energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, and instrumentalness.
+ **Full Artist Discography:** Load an artist's complete collection, including singles, albums, and compilations, for sorting, with all duplicate tracks removed.
+ **Dynamic Playlists:** Create self-updating playlists from any combination of sources (playlists, artists, albums) that automatically stay updated and sorted on a custom schedule.
+ **Playlist Creation:** Generate specialized playlists like 'New Releases from Followed Artists', 'Discovery Mixes', and your 'Top Tracks' for different time periods.
+ **Extra Data Columns:** Add an extra column to playlists, albums, and artist pages (Play Count, Release Date, Scrobbles, DJ Info, Key, BPM, and more).
+ **Advanced Custom Filter:** Fine-tune playlists with keywords and range sliders for play count, release date, duration, and various audio features (BPM, energy, danceability).
+ **Genre Filtering:** Filter any playlist or discography by genre, using combined data from Spotify and Last.fm.
+ **AI-Powered Playlists:** Generate playlists from prompts, using the current context as a music source with Gemini models.

+ **Smart Deduplication:** Remove duplicate tracks from playlists, automatically keeping the most popular version.
+ **Smart Shuffle:** Randomize your playlist with an intelligent shuffle that helps prevent multiple songs by the same artist from playing back-to-back.
